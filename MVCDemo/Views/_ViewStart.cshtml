@{
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}

@*Note: we can also write some logic in "_ViewStart.cshtml" to dynamically specify which layout file to use?*@
@*@{
    Layout = Request.Browser.IsBrowser("Chrome") ? "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml" : "~/Views/Shared/_DifferentLayout.cshtml";
}*@

@*If you want a set of views in a specific folder, to use a different layout file, then you can include 
another _ViewStart.cshtml file in that specific folder.*@
